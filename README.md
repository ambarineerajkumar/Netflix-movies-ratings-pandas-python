# Introduction
In this project, we analyze a dataset containing information about movies and series available on Netflix. Using Pandas, we perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to extract meaningful insights. Our goal is to understand trends related to genres, IMDb scores, awards, box office performance, and availability across countries.
